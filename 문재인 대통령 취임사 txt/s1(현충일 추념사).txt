Fellow Koreans, decorated patriots and veterans and families of the fallen,
Marking the 62nd Memorial Day, I bow deeply before the noble souls of
those who sacrificed themselves for the country. My sympathy and gratitude go out
to the families of those who lost loved ones in the cause of protecting the homeland.
I also pay my heartfelt tribute to those who served the country with distinction.
Today, I think of patriotism here at the National Cemetery. Had it not been
for the patriotism of our people, we would not have the Republic of Korea of today.
Our history has been interspersed with incessant ordeals ranging from colonialization, division and war to poverty and struggles against dictatorships. It was patriotism that enabled us to overcome all these tribulations. The past century has been
turned into our proud history.
Fellow Koreans,
It was the conviction of our independence activists that made it possible to
keep the name of our country, the Republic of Korea. From volunteer righteous
armies to the Korean Liberation Army against imperialist Japan, the conviction to
restore national sovereignty and achieve self-reliant independence was embedded in
the national flag, the Taegeukgi. Even when their bodies were slashed and their nails
pulled out, they never deserted their country, flying the Taegeukgi in their hearts.
The people fostered independence fighters and supported the independence movement, unwaveringly living in sorrow over their lost country. This is patriotism.
It took many long years—even after liberation—until our independence activists and their descendants were honored by the nation. The reality is, however,
still contrary to what it should be—the children and grandchildren of independence
fighters have lived in poverty while the children and grandchildren of pro-Japanese
collaborators have thrived.
