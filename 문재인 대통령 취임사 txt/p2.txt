During this presidential election, our people made history again. A new
President was elected through even support from all across the country. Starting
today, I will become a president for everyone. Even those who did not support me
are my people, and I will serve them all alike.
I dare to make a promise. This date—May 10, 2017—will go down in history
as the beginning of the genuine unity of the people.
My fellow Koreans,
Over the past several troubling months, many people asked whether this
country can indeed be called a country. From this very question, I will make a new
start as President. From today, I will become a president dedicated to building a
country worthy of being called a country.
I will boldly break from the malpractices of old days. As President, I will take
the lead in starting anew.
First and foremost, I will strive to get rid of authoritarian practices in the
presidency. When preparations are completed, I am going to leave Cheong Wa Dae
to usher in an era of the presidential office in Gwanghwamun Square. There, my
aides and I will put our heads together and have discussions. I will frequently engage
in communication with the people. On key issues, I myself will hold press briefings.
On my way home, I will drop by markets to talk freely with citizens I encounter. Large public forums will be occasionally held at Gwanghwamun Square.
The President's imperial power will be shared as much as possible. I will make sure
that agencies that have great authority remain completely independent from politics. There will be a system to keep these agencies in check so that none of them will
be able to wield absolute power.
