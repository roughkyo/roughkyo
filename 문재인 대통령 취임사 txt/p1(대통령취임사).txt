My fellow Koreans,
I am grateful to you all. I bow my head in deep appreciation for the choice
of you, the people. Today, serving as President in the 19th presidential term of the
Republic of Korea, I take the first step toward a new Korea. My shoulders are now
burdened with heavy mandates entrusted to me by the people, and my heart is burning with enthusiasm to create the kind of country that we have never been able to
live in before. My head is now filled with blueprints for ushering in a new world
characterized by unity and coexistence.
The new Republic of Korea we are trying to build is the nation that those who
came before us have consistently aspired to in the face of countless frustrations and
defeats. It is the nation that our young people have longed for so ardently, in spite of
many sacrifices and dedicated efforts. To build such a Republic of Korea, I declare
before history and the people with a fearful but humble mind that I will faithfully
fulfill my responsibilities and missions as President.
I offer my gratitude and sympathy from deep in my heart to the other presidential contenders. There is no winner or loser in this election. We are all partners
who are required to lead the new Republic of Korea together. Now is the time to
leave behind the heat of competition and move forward together hand in hand.
My fellow Koreans,
We have gone through unprecedented political upheavals over the past few
months. Politics was in disarray but our people were great. Even with the impeachment and arrest of the sitting President, our people paved a way forward for the
Republic of Korea. They never got discouraged but instead turned the crisis into an
opportunity, eventually opening the way to a new world today. The greatness of the
Republic of Korea is the greatness of the people.
