There must be an unshakable belief that those who make contributions to
the country will be compensated, while traitors will be judged. That is a properly
functioning country for which people can demonstrate their patriotism.
Let’s build a nation together, in which patriotism, justice, principle and honesty are rewarded. Let’s build a fair country together where the success of individuals
and businesses simultaneously constitutes the road toward patriotism.
Again, I commemorate the memory of patriotic martyrs and fallen heroes
who sacrificed themselves in the defense of the country or fought for democracy. I
pray for the repose of their souls.
Thank you very much.
