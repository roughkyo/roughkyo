More than anything else, my Administration will not repeat the unfortunate
past practices of utilizing the history of patriotism for governance. I will end politics
controlled along ideological lines that instigate an us-versus-them mindset, which
regarded the war experience as a means for ruling, rather than focusing on treating
the aftereffects of the war.
Fellow Koreans, decorated patriots and veterans and their families,
I declare here today clearly that the welfare of veterans and patriots is a road
toward the unity of the people and a robust nation.
The welfare policy for veterans and patriots in the country has been developed steadily so far. It started from military support, to include treatment provided
with respect and compensation for veterans. Its scope has also expanded from persons of national merit who sacrificed themselves in the defense of the country to
include those who fought for independence or democracy, or who were injured or
killed on official duty. Though we were not able to serve some of the military and
police, or some public servants and righteous people whose worth needed to be
honored as persons of national merit, we have come up with legislation to provide
them with respectful treatment and support. All these, however, have been far short
of matching the level of their contributions and failed to reach the standard asked
for by the people in terms of common sense and their expectations.
Now I will take a step further. If the National Assembly agrees, I will lift the
status of the Ministry of Patriots and Veterans Affairs and upgrade it to a ministerial-level organization. I will make sure that persons of national merit, veteran welfare
recipients and their families can live with pride.
