Thanks to the dedication and sacrifice of the Korean Vietnamese War veterans, the Korean economy was resuscitated. They unhesitatingly answered the call
of the Republic of Korea. They carried out their missions silently, prevailing over
hardships in sweltering heat waves and jungles. This is patriotism.
Diseases and disabilities resulting from that war on foreign soil are the debt
the Government should also be held accountable for. Now it is the Government’s
turn to give an appropriate answer. We will repay their service with proper treatment and honor. That is what is required of the nation.
My fellow Koreans,
Today, I join you in remembering the fact that dedication to and sacrifice for
the country did not take place only on battlefields. At a time when the country was
desperately in need of foreign currency and even any single dollar it could get, there
were Koreans who made important contributions to the country’s modernization
while working in Germany, a foreign land far away from home. Korean miners sent
to Germany, engulfed in coal dust and soaked in sweat in hot underground mines,
worked to dig up coal. Korean nurses sent to Germany endured all forms of unpleasant work at hospitals. Their devotion and sacrifice laid a stepping stone for the
country’s economy. This is patriotism.
I am also grateful for the sacrifice and dedicated efforts of those female workers, who devoted the prime of their lives working in attic workshops that lined the
Cheonggyecheon stream, the ceilings of which were so low they could not stand up
straight. They worked at sewing machines with bleary eyes and had cracked fingertips removing stitches. They were called female factory workers instead of patriots,
but they were the ones who helped achieve the Miracle on the Han River. This is
patriotism.
