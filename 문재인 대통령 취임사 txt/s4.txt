Today, on behalf of the Government, I honor deep in my heart those who are
now aged and recalling the times when they exerted all their efforts for their poor
country.
Fellow citizens, decorated patriots and veterans and families of fallen heroes,
The Korea of today was built on patriotism. Every single individual who dedicated themselves to the nation makes up the Republic of Korea. They themselves in
their entirety are the Republic of Korea, a nation that is not and cannot be divided
into liberals and conservatives.
The flags independence fighters embraced were also fluttering on many ridges where battles were waged to capture hilltop positions. The flags flown when seeing off coal miners and nurses to Germany were also flown at the time of the May 18
Democratization Movement in 1980 and the June Struggle in 1987. The flags were
etched deep in the minds of our brave sailors who risked their lives to defend our
maritime territory in the West Sea and their bereaved families. They differed in how
they showed love of country, but still, they were all patriots.
A new Republic of Korea has to start from here. Reconciliation has to be realized with our hearts, going beyond our institutions. There was neither left nor right
in getting the country back, and neither young nor old in safeguarding the country.
As such, our people stood at the very center of the history of patriotism.
My Administration and I will honor and keep the legacy of patriotism. I earnestly ask all those who devoted themselves to the defense of the Republic of Korea
to take the lead with that same patriotism in further promoting unity in Korea. You
are the ones who can put an end to ideological conflict in this country. It is you all
who have loved the homeland throughout your whole life and who can now end
hatred, confrontation and conflict between generations in this country.
