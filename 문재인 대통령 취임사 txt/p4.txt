I will become an honest president who keeps promises. I will meticulously
honor the pledges I made during the campaign. Genuine political progress will be
possible only when the president takes the initiative in engaging in trustworthy politics. I will not talk big about doing the impossible. I will admit to the wrong I did. I
will not cover up unfavorable public opinion with lies.
I will be a fair president. I will explore ways to ceate a world without privileges and foul play. I will endeavor to create a world where those who follow common
sense will benefit. I will not overlook the pain of our neighbors. I will always be vigilant with a great sense of caring so that there will be no one left behind. I will become
a president who comforts people in sorrow.
I will be a president who communicates with others. I will exert my authority
in a humble and modest manner; I will build a country stronger than it has ever
been. I will not be a president who is domineering and authoritative but one who
communicates and promotes dialogue.
I will stay close to the people, working near Gwanghwamun. I will become a
president who remains warmhearted and friendly to the people.
My fellow Koreans,
The Republic of Korea starts anew today, on May 10, 2017. A great history of
building a decent nation begins. I ask you all to join me on this journey. I will fully
dedicate myself to it.
Thank you very much.
