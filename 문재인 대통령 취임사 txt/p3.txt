I will perform my duties with humility. I will become a president who is at
eye level with the people.
I will endeavor to address the security crisis promptly. For the sake of peace
on the Korean Peninsula, I will crisscross the globe. If needed, I will immediately fly
to Washington. I will also visit Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang under the
right circumstances.
I remain committed to doing all I can for the establishment of peace on the
Korean Peninsula. The ROK-U.S. alliance will be further strengthened. In the meantime, I will have serious discussions with the United States and China for the resolution of issues related to THAAD.
Strong security is made possible by strong defense capabilities. The Government will also strive to further enhance independent defense capabilities. It will also
lay the foundation for the resolution of the North Korean nuclear problem. The
Government will endeavor to establish peace in Northeast Asia, thus setting a milestone in alleviating tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
I will make efforts to change the landscape of politics characterized by division and conflicts. Confrontations between conservatives and progressives must
come to an end. As President, I will take the lead in engaging in dialogues. Opposition parties are partners in the administration of state affairs. Discussions will be
held on a regular basis, and I will take time to have meetings.
